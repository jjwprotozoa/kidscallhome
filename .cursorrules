You are working in the KidsCallHome repository.

The WebRTC call engine (call connection, video, and audio) is currently STABLE and MUST NOT be changed accidentally.

The golden working commit is:

- Commit: b6c35a4

- Branch: feature/audio-notifications

- Tag (if present): calls-stable-b6c35a4

Your priorities:

1. Do NOT break the working call engine.

2. Only touch call-related core files when the user explicitly asks you to.

3. Keep the implementation well-documented so humans can understand and extend it safely.

## 1. Protected call engine scope

Treat the following as **protected, high-risk** files and modules:

- WebRTC / call hooks and core:

  - `src/hooks/useVideoCall.ts`

  - `src/hooks/useWebRTC.ts`

  - `src/hooks/useCallEngine.ts`

  - `src/utils/childCallHandler.ts`

  - `src/utils/callHandlers.ts`

  - `src/utils/callEnding.ts`

- Call UI:

  - `src/components/call/VideoCallUI.tsx`

  - `src/pages/ParentCallScreen.tsx`

  - `src/pages/ChildCallScreen.tsx`

- Call notifications:

  - `src/hooks/useIncomingCallNotifications.ts`

  - `src/hooks/useAudioNotifications.ts`

- Dashboard incoming call subscriptions:

  - `src/pages/ParentDashboard.tsx` (incoming call subscription setup)

  - `src/pages/ChildDashboard.tsx` (incoming call subscription setup)

- Data model (Supabase):

  - Any migrations or SQL defining:

    - `public.calls`

    - `public.parent_ice_candidates`

    - `public.child_ice_candidates`

- Call documentation:

  - `docs/webrtc-calls-overview.md`

  - `CALLS_TEST_PLAN.md` (if present)

  - Any other call-engine docs in `docs/` or `src/features/calls/`

### 1.1. When you MAY NOT modify protected call engine code

By default, you MUST NOT:

- Change logic related to:

  - Role detection (`parent` vs `child`)

  - Offer/answer creation and setting local/remote descriptions

  - ICE candidate writing/reading

  - Call state transitions (`ringing`, `in_call`, `ended`, etc.)

  - Media acquisition (`getUserMedia`) and track management

- Rename or remove:

  - `calls`, `parent_ice_candidates`, `child_ice_candidates` tables

- Change behavior of:

  - `useVideoCall`, `useWebRTC`, `childCallHandler`, `callHandlers`, `callEnding`

- Modify critical patterns:

  - Navigation after call ends (must use route-based `isChild` state, not session checks)

  - Incoming call subscription setup (must include filters and status callbacks)

  - Answer creation when waiting for offer (must verify tracks and SDP)

You may add or adjust **documentation and comments** in these files, but DO NOT change runtime behavior unless the user explicitly requests it (see 1.2).

### 1.2. When you MAY modify protected call engine code

Only modify protected call engine code if the user clearly says they want to change it.

Examples of explicit permission:

- "Change the call engine so that …"

- "Override the call engine protection and update WebRTC to support X."

- "It's okay to modify useVideoCall / useWebRTC for this new behavior."

If the user's request is ambiguous (e.g. "simplify things" or "clean up the code") you MUST:

- Prefer changes **outside** the protected call engine, or

- Ask the user to explicitly confirm that the call engine may be modified.

When modifying call engine code:

- Keep the current working behavior (parent ↔ child calls with video/audio) unless the user specifically wants different behavior.

- Preserve the parent→child and child→parent flows and ICE/role wiring.

- After changes, update the call documentation as described in section 3.

## 2. Logging and debug rules for calls

The call engine should be quiet by default but debuggable.

- Prefer using a dedicated logger (e.g. `callLogger` or `callLog`) instead of raw `console.log`.

- Raw `console.log` inside call engine files should be avoided or downgraded to the logger.

- Always keep real error logs:

  - `getUserMedia` failures

  - `setLocalDescription` / `setRemoteDescription` failures

  - `addIceCandidate` failures

  - Supabase errors creating/updating call/ICE rows

If you need more debug output for development:

- Use a flag-based approach (e.g. `CALL_DEBUG` via localStorage or env var) and keep verbose logs behind that flag.

- Do NOT add permanent noisy logging to the call engine without gating it behind such a flag.

## 3. Documentation requirements for the call engine

Whenever you TOUCH any protected call engine file (even for small changes), you MUST:

1. Update or create a detailed architecture doc (if not already present) such as:

   - `docs/webrtc-calls-overview.md`

2. Ensure the doc clearly covers:

   - Data model:

     - Columns and purpose of `public.calls`

     - Purpose and usage pattern of `parent_ice_candidates` and `child_ice_candidates`

   - Flow descriptions:

     - Parent → Child call flow:

       - How a call row is created

       - Where the offer is stored

       - How the child finds and answers the call

       - How ICE candidates are exchanged

     - Child → Parent call flow (mirrored)

   - Client modules:

     - Role of `useVideoCall`

     - Role of `useWebRTC`

     - What `childCallHandler` and `callHandlers` do

     - What `callEnding` does

   - State model:

     - Call states (`idle`, `calling`, `incoming`, `connecting`, `in_call`, `ended`, etc.)

     - How UI uses these states

3. Keep or update a **test checklist** in `CALLS_TEST_PLAN.md` (or the main doc) that at least includes:

   - Parent → Child call happy path

   - Child → Parent call happy path

   - Hangup from parent

   - Hangup from child

   - Behavior on browser refresh or reconnect

The documentation should be written so that a new engineer can understand:

- How calls work end-to-end

- Where to change behavior safely

- How to manually test the flows

## 4. Safe refactor / cleanup rules

When the user asks for refactors or cleanups:

- Prefer refactoring code AROUND the call engine:

  - UI layout, styling, routing wrappers, unrelated components

  - Non-call-related Supabase queries or features

- For call engine files:

  - You may:

    - Improve comments

    - Rename variables for clarity (without changing logic)

    - Replace `console.log` with the shared `callLogger` pattern

  - You MUST NOT:

    - Change function signatures of public APIs (e.g. `useVideoCall` hook shape) unless the user explicitly requests it.

    - Change how roles map to ICE tables.

    - Change which tables are used for calls.

If in doubt, preserve existing behavior. The call engine is considered critical and working.

## 5. Critical patterns that MUST be preserved

The following patterns are **CRITICAL** and must NOT be modified without explicit user verification:

### 5.1. Navigation after call ends

**Location**: `src/hooks/useVideoCall.ts` - `endCall()` function and termination listener

**Pattern**: Navigation MUST use route-based `isChild` state, NOT session checks

**Why**: Session checks can fail if sessions are cleared during call, causing incorrect navigation

**Code pattern**:

```typescript
// CORRECT: Use route-based isChild state
if (isChild) {
  navigate("/child/dashboard");
} else {
  navigate("/parent/dashboard");
}

// WRONG: Don't re-check sessions
const isChildUser = !session && !!childSession;
if (isChildUser) { ... }
```

**Protection**: If modifying navigation logic, you MUST verify it uses route-based state detection.

### 5.2. Incoming call subscription setup

**Location**:

- `src/pages/ParentDashboard.tsx` - `setupSubscription()` function
- `src/pages/ChildDashboard.tsx` - `setupSubscription()` function

**Pattern**: Subscriptions MUST include:

1. Database-level filters (`filter: parent_id=eq.${user.id}` or `child_id=eq.${childData.id}`)
2. Subscription status callback with error handling
3. Both INSERT and UPDATE event listeners

**Why**: Filters ensure Supabase realtime only sends relevant events. Status callbacks detect subscription failures.

**Code pattern**:

```typescript
channelRef.current = supabase
  .channel("parent-incoming-calls")
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "INSERT",
      schema: "public",
      table: "calls",
      filter: `parent_id=eq.${user.id}`, // REQUIRED: Database-level filter
    },
    handler
  )
  .subscribe((status) => {
    // REQUIRED: Status callback with error handling
    if (status === "SUBSCRIBED") {
      console.log("Successfully subscribed");
    } else if (status === "CHANNEL_ERROR" || status === "TIMED_OUT") {
      // Handle retry
    }
  });
```

**Protection**: If modifying subscription setup, you MUST preserve filters and status callbacks.

### 5.3. Answer creation with track verification

**Location**: `src/utils/callHandlers.ts` - Parent handler when answering child-initiated calls

**Pattern**: When creating an answer (especially when waiting for offer), MUST:

1. Verify tracks exist before creating answer
2. Verify answer SDP includes media tracks
3. Match the pattern used in main answer path

**Why**: Missing track verification causes silent failures where video/audio don't work

**Code pattern**:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Verify tracks before creating answer
const senderTracks = pc
  .getSenders()
  .map((s) => s.track)
  .filter(Boolean);
if (senderTracks.length === 0) {
  throw new Error("Cannot create answer: no media tracks found");
}

const answer = await pc.createAnswer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(answer);

// REQUIRED: Verify answer SDP includes media tracks
const hasAudio = answer.sdp?.includes("m=audio");
const hasVideo = answer.sdp?.includes("m=video");
if (!hasAudio && !hasVideo) {
  throw new Error("Answer SDP missing media tracks");
}
```

**Protection**: If modifying answer creation logic, you MUST preserve track and SDP verification in ALL paths (main path and "waiting for offer" path).

### 5.4. Modification protocol

**BEFORE modifying any of the above patterns**, you MUST:

1. **Ask the user explicitly**: "I need to modify [pattern name]. This is a critical pattern. Are you sure you want to change this?"

2. **Explain the impact**: Describe what could break if the pattern is changed

3. **Verify the change**: After modification, ensure the pattern still works correctly

4. **Update this section**: If the pattern changes, update this documentation

**Exception**: Only modify without asking if the user explicitly says "override the protection" or "it's okay to modify [specific pattern]".

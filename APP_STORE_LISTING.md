## Full Description

Kids Call Home is a safe video calling and messaging app designed specifically for children to connect with parents and trusted family members. Unlike typical kids messaging apps, Kids Call Home works without a phone number or SIM card—perfect for tablets, iPads, and Wi‑Fi devices. Parents control every contact, ensuring kids can only reach approved family members. No strangers, no public profiles, no random friend requests.

**Family-Only Calls, No Strangers**

Your child can only call and message people you've explicitly approved. There's no search feature, no public profiles, and no way for strangers to contact your child. Unlike apps that allow "friends of friends" or open discovery, Kids Call Home keeps communication strictly within your trusted family circle. Parents create accounts, add child profiles, and approve every family member who can connect—grandparents, co‑parents, aunts, uncles, and other trusted caregivers.

**Perfect for Tablets and Wi‑Fi Devices**

Kids Call Home works great on iPads, Android tablets, Kindle Fire, and Chromebooks—no SIM card or phone plan required. Perfect for families who want their children to stay connected without giving them a full smartphone. Your child simply opens the app, enters their login code, and can call approved family members over Wi‑Fi or mobile data. Ideal for kids who don't have their own phone but need a safe way to reach family.

**Built for Co‑Parents and Long‑Distance Family**

Kids can easily call both parents in different homes, grandparents overseas, and extended family across countries. Parents control which family members are approved, making it ideal for shared custody situations and international families. Whether your child needs to reach mom's house, dad's house, or grandparents thousands of miles away, Kids Call Home makes family communication simple and safe.

**Privacy-First, Designed for Kids**

Calls and messages are encrypted to protect your family's communication. The app collects minimal data—only what's necessary for the service to function—and never sells or shares your family's data with advertisers or third parties. There are no ads, no manipulative design patterns like infinite feeds or aggressive notifications, and no surprise in‑app purchases. Kids Call Home is designed to be a simple, safe communication tool, not a platform for engagement or monetization.

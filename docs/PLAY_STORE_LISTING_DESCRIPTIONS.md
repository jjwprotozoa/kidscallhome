Kids Call Home - Safe Video Calling for Kids

Safe video calls for kids to connect with family—no phone number or SIM card needed. Family-only contacts you approve, with strong privacy protection and no social feeds, games, or strangers. Perfect for tablets (iPad, Android, Kindle Fire, Chromebook) and phones with Wi‑Fi or data. Great for co‑parents and long‑distance families who want kids to easily reach both homes safely.

HOW WE KEEP KIDS SAFE

Kids Call Home is designed to avoid the biggest risks parents worry about in kids messaging apps:

• NO STRANGERS: Kids can only call approved family contacts you set—no open search, no friend requests, no random messages from unknown people.

• NO SOCIAL FEEDS: No endless scrolling, games, or random content that feeds screen addiction. Just simple calling and messaging with family.

• NO ADS OR TRICKY PURCHASES: Clean interface with no advertising and no dark‑pattern in‑app purchases. Transparent pricing you control.

• STRONG PRIVACY: End‑to‑end encryption for calls and messages, minimal data collection, and we never sell or share your family's data with advertisers or third parties.

• SIMPLE PARENT CONTROLS: Easy setup without needing extra monitoring apps. You approve every contact, manage access, and see who your child can reach.

PERFECT FOR:

• Kids with tablets (iPad, Android tablets, Kindle Fire, Chromebook) who don't have phone service
• Families who want safe, controlled communication without the complexity of social networks
• Co‑parents and shared custody situations where kids need to easily reach both homes
• Long‑distance families connecting kids with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and trusted caregivers overseas

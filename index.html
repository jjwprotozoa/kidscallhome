      <h1>Safe video calls for kids — no phone or SIM required</h1>
      <p>
        Kids Call Home is a family-only video calling and safe kids messaging
        app that lets children call parents and family without needing a SIM
        card or phone number. Works perfectly on tablets, iPads, Kindle Fire,
        Chromebooks and many other Wi‑Fi devices. Parents control all
        contacts—no strangers, no public profiles, no random friend requests.
      </p>

      <h2>Family-only calls, no strangers</h2>
      <p>
        Only parent-approved family members can connect with your child. There
        is no public profile, no search feature, and no random friend requests.
        Your child can only communicate with people you've explicitly approved,
        making it safer than typical kids messaging apps that allow "friends of
        friends" or public discovery.
      </p>

      <h2>Works on tablets, iPads, and Wi‑Fi devices</h2>
      <p>
        Kids Call Home works great on tablets, iPads, Kindle Fire, Chromebooks
        and many other Wi‑Fi devices when kids don't have their own phones or
        SIM cards. No phone plan or phone number required. Perfect for families
        who want their children to stay connected without giving them a full
        smartphone.
      </p>

      <h2>Built for co‑parents and long‑distance family</h2>
      <p>
        Kids can easily call both parents in different homes and extended family
        across countries. Ideal for shared custody situations, co‑parenting
        communication and international families. Parents control which family
        members are approved, ensuring safe communication across all family
        structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy-first design for kids</h2>
      <p>
        Calls and messages are encrypted to protect your family's communication.
        The app uses minimal data, doesn't use tracking for ads, and does not
        sell family data to advertisers or partners. There are no manipulative
        "dark pattern" features like infinite feeds, aggressive notifications,
        time pressure, or surprise in‑app purchases. Kids Call Home is designed
        to be a simple, safe communication tool, not a platform for engagement
        or monetization.
      </p>

        <h1>Safe video calls for kids — no phone or SIM required</h1>
        <p>
          Kids Call Home is a family-only video calling and safe kids messaging
          app that lets children call parents and family without needing a SIM
          card or phone number. Works perfectly on tablets, iPads, Kindle Fire,
          and Chromebooks over Wi‑Fi. Parents control all contacts—no strangers,
          no public profiles, no random friend requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Family-only calls, no strangers</h2>
        <p>
          Only parent-approved family members can connect with your child. There
          is no public profile, no search feature, and no random friend
          requests. Your child can only communicate with people you've
          explicitly approved, making it safer than typical kids messaging apps
          that allow "friends of friends" or public discovery.
        </p>

        <h2>Works on tablets, iPads, and Wi‑Fi devices</h2>
        <p>
          Kids Call Home works great on tablets, iPads, Kindle Fire, and
          Chromebooks over Wi‑Fi when kids don't have their own phones or SIM
          cards. No phone plan or phone number required. Perfect for families
          who want their children to stay connected without giving them a full
          smartphone.
        </p>

        <h2>Built for co‑parents and long‑distance family</h2>
        <p>
          Kids can easily call both parents in different homes and extended
          family across countries. Ideal for shared custody situations and
          international families. Parents control which family members are
          approved, ensuring safe communication across all family structures.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy-first design for kids</h2>
        <p>
          Calls and messages are encrypted to protect your family's
          communication. The app uses minimal data, doesn't use tracking for
          ads, and does not sell family data to advertisers or partners. There
          are no manipulative "dark pattern" features like infinite feeds,
          aggressive notifications, time pressure, or surprise in‑app
          purchases. Kids Call Home is designed to be a simple, safe
          communication tool, not a platform for engagement or monetization.
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>How can my child call me from a tablet without a SIM card?</h3>
        <p>
          Kids Call Home works perfectly on tablets, iPads, Kindle Fire, and
          Chromebooks over Wi‑Fi without needing a SIM card or phone number.
          Your child simply opens the app, enters their login code, and can call
          approved family members. Parents control all contacts, so only family
          members you approve can connect with your child.
        </p>

        <h3>Is this app safer than typical kids messaging apps?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Kids Call Home is designed specifically for family-only
          communication. Unlike many kids messaging apps, there are no public
          profiles, no search features, no friend requests from strangers, and
          no "friends of friends" connections. Only parent-approved family
          members can contact your child. The app uses encrypted communication,
          collects minimal data, does not show ads, and does not sell family
          data to advertisers or partners.
        </p>

        <h3>How does Kids Call Home protect my child's privacy?</h3>
        <p>
          Kids Call Home uses encrypted calls and messages to protect your
          family's communication. The app collects minimal data necessary for
          the service to function, does not use tracking for advertising
          purposes, and does not sell family data. There are no manipulative
          design patterns like infinite feeds, aggressive notifications, or
          surprise in‑app purchases. Parents have full control over who can
          contact their child.
        </p>

        <h3>Can my child use this to call both parents in different homes?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Kids Call Home is built for co‑parents and long‑distance family.
          Your child can easily call both parents, grandparents, and other
          approved family members across different homes and even different
          countries. Parents control which family members are approved, making
          it ideal for shared custody situations and international families.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Kids Call Home work on iPads and tablets?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Kids Call Home works great on iPads, Android tablets, Kindle
          Fire, and Chromebooks. It works over Wi‑Fi without needing a SIM card
          or phone number, making it perfect for kids who don't have their own
          phone. The app is also available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it
          can be added to the home screen like a native app.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there ads or in‑app purchases in Kids Call Home?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Kids Call Home has no ads, no in‑app purchases, and no
          manipulative design features. The app is designed to be a simple, safe
          communication tool for families, not a platform for engagement or
          monetization. Your child's attention stays on connecting with family,
          not on games, feeds, or notifications designed to keep them online
          longer.

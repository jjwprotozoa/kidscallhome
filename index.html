        <h3>How does Kids Call Home protect my child's privacy?</h3>
        <p>Kids Call Home uses encrypted calls and messages to protect your family's communication. The app collects minimal data necessary for the service to function, does not use tracking for advertising purposes, and does not sell family data. There are no manipulative design patterns like infinite feeds, aggressive notifications, or surprise in‑app purchases. Parents have full control over who can contact their child.</p>
        
        <h3>Can my child use this to call both parents in different homes?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Kids Call Home is built for co‑parents and long‑distance family. Your child can easily call both parents, grandparents, and other approved family members across different homes and even different countries. Parents control which family members are approved, making it ideal for shared custody situations and international families.</p>
        
        <h3>Does Kids Call Home work on iPads and tablets?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Kids Call Home works great on iPads, Android tablets, Kindle Fire, and Chromebooks. It works over Wi‑Fi without needing a SIM card or phone number, making it perfect for kids who don't have their own phone. The app is also available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be added to the home screen like a native app.</p>
        
        <h3>Are there ads or in‑app purchases in Kids Call Home?</h3>
        <p>No. Kids Call Home has no ads, no in‑app purchases, and no manipulative design features. The app is designed to be a simple, safe communication tool for families, not a platform for engagement or monetization. Your child's attention stays on connecting with family, not on games, feeds, or notifications designed to keep them online longer.</p>

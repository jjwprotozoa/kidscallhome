        <h1>Low Data Video Calls for Families</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You have slow internet, limited data, or a weak WiFi connection, but you still need to stay connected with your family.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Kids Call Home is optimized for low-bandwidth environments. It works on slow WiFi, 2G/3G connections, and areas with limited internet speed.</p>
        
        <h2>Optimized for Low Bandwidth</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficient Data Usage:</strong> Uses less data than traditional video calling apps</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Quality:</strong> Automatically adjusts video quality based on connection speed</li>
            <li><strong>Works on 2G/3G:</strong> Designed to work even on slower mobile networks</li>
            <li><strong>Slow WiFi Friendly:</strong> Functions on weak or shared WiFi connections</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Perfect For:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rural areas with slow internet</li>
            <li>Families with limited data plans</li>
            <li>International calls on slow connections</li>
            <li>School WiFi or public hotspots</li>
            <li>Areas with 2G/3G mobile networks</li>
            <li>Shared internet connections</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Kids Call Home uses WebRTC technology that automatically adapts to your connection speed. If your internet is slow, the video quality adjusts to ensure the call stays connected. Audio prioritization ensures you can always hear each other, even if video needs to reduce quality.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Usage Comparison</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional Apps:</strong> Often require 1-2 Mbps for smooth video</li>
            <li><strong>Kids Call Home:</strong> Works with as little as 256 Kbps</li>
            <li><strong>Audio-Only Mode:</strong> Uses minimal data if video isn't needed</li>
        </ul>
